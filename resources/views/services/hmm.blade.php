                        Since its inception in 1976, Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM) has continuously endeavored to become a premier global shipping and logistics company.
                        HMM is currently one of the top five Trans-Pacific carriers and one of the top 10 carriers in the global shipping industry with a varied sized fleet for Trans-Pacific, Asia-Europe, Trans-Atlantic and Inter-Asia trade.
                        Our legacy of customer service excellence proudly contin-
                        ues. For example, HMM has expanded container service to niche markets in South America, Australia and Russia.
                        Other significant accomplishments include: expansion of inland live reefer service, improved Regional Customer Service Center (RCSC) service, service, and upgraded electronic service on the Mobile devices - sailing schedules, rate requests, online booking, cargo tracking & tracing, and Internet B/L service, etc.

                        Future plans include the upsizing of our vessels, capacity increase in special container service (Jumbo and Reefer service), extension of service scope to new markets, and linking the finest internet shipping portal in the world providing complete and fully integrated customer services on the Web. In addition, HMM will as always, continue to add new shipping routes and tonnage, resources to improve electronic services, and further streamline existing programs, services, etc.
                        Ever striving to be the best, we plan to launch strategic initiatives to ensure even greater capacity, flexibility and quality for the new millennium. As with all HMM plans, these strategies are acutely focused on increasing customer service and satisfaction.

                        With the ending of the G6 consortium in April HMM formed in April 2017, a co-operation agreement with the 2M Alliance providing a competitive network covering services between Asia and West Coast USA, Asia and East Coast USA, Asia and North Europe, Asia and the Mediterranean, Europe/North America and North America/Europe trades.
                        In addition, HMM established a new extensive Intra-Asia network(including Korea – Vietnam/Japan) with the cooperation of two other Korean Carriers.
                        After all, our philosophy is simple: HMM is proactive in meeting customer demands and dedicated to customer satisfaction with a management team who, being customer oriented and committed to high business ethics, are constantly pursuing innovation and service expansion for customer benefit and satisfaction.
                        Our continued success ensured, we can transfer happiness to individual, family and global community getting over the customer satisfaction through logistics solution.
