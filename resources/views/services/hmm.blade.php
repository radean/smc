                        Since launching our first service with three VLCCs
                        (Very Large Crude Carriers) in 1976, HMM has
                        substantially expanded into the world-class integrated
                        logistics service provider by adding various types of
                        vessels – container ships, bulk carriers, trampers,
                        heavy lifts, and special product carriers – hence
                        sharpening the competitive edge. As a result, HMM
                        has gained a diverse business portfolio and structure
                        that can yield stable revenue despite the market
                        change in certain fields of the shipping industry.
